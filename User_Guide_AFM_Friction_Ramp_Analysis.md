# AFM-Friction-Ramp-Analysis User Guide

This python application can be used to analyze ramps/series of AFM lateral force images, providing the correspondig friction vs load plots. 

At present it has only been tested for images obtained with the Nanoscope v9 software on a Multimode 8 AFM. It will probably work for images obtained with some other Nanoscope versions and Bruker/Veeco AFMs, but I am not sure.

## Quick Start

1. Clone/fetch/download the repository.
2. A venv virtual environment is provided with the repository. To activate it, just go to the main folder and type:
```python
source env/bin/activate
```

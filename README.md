# AFM-Friction-Ramp-Analysis
GUI for analysis of ramps of lateral force images obtained with Atomic Force Microscopes.
This version works (or has been only tested with) images obtained with obtained with the Nanoscope v9 Software and a Multimode 8 AFM. I would be happy to improve it in order to read data from other AFMs. If you are interested, please contact me.

I have also written a short [user guide](User_Guide_AFM_Friction_Ramp_Analysis.md).
